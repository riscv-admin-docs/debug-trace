The debug and trace HSC is responsible for defining the strategy and identifying gaps necessary to successfully do both debug and trace functions within the RISC-V ecosystem. This includes working with or spawning Task Groups to do extensions as well as providing specification on how those extensions work within the ecosystem. There may be many debug and trace facilities in the RISC-V ecosystem and this committee will endeavor to provide a foundation that allows them all to be successful. Finally the committee will help provide oversight for the work being done to develop tests and implementations for the extensions.
